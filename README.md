# Dashboard Project

This repository contains an Angular dashboard application.

## Clone the repository

Replace `<repo-url>` with the GitHub repository URL for this project and run:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd dashboard-project
```

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (recommended: >= 18)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or `pnpm`/`yarn` if you prefer
- Git

## Install dependencies

From the project root run:

```bash
npm install
```

Or, if you use Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Run the development server

Start the app locally (the script uses the Angular dev server):

```bash
npm start
```

Or run the Angular CLI directly:

```bash
npx ng serve --open
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:4200/ and will reload on source changes.

## Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Tests

Run unit tests:

```bash
npm test
```

## Notes

- If the repository uses a different folder name after cloning, replace `dashboard-project` with the actual folder name created by `git clone`.
- If you need a specific Node.js version, consider using `nvm` or `nvm-windows` to manage versions.

If you want, I can also add a short CONTRIBUTING section or update package scripts—tell me which you'd prefer.
